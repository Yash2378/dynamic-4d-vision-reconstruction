# Notes: 3D Gaussian Splatting

## What is 3D Gaussian Splatting?
- It is an cutting edge technology that can be used for representing and rendering 3D scenes in real time, offering an alternative to neural radiance fields(NeRFs).

AREA OF FOCUS:
- Splat parameterization (position, rotation, scale, opacity)

- Scene visibility logic

- Comparison to NeRF speed + quality
